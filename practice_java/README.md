# Practice Java

I started this subproject to get familiar other languages like Java and to keep my algorithmic knowledge sharp.

I organized the code into sub folders as I explained below:

## Interview Cake
Contains the finished exercises from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)

## Practice
Contains implementation of common algorithms, data structures and challenges I found randomly.
