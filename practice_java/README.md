# Practice Java

I like to discover languages and tools, so I started this little subproject to see how the implementation looks of common data structures and problems in Java.

I organised the code into sub folders as stated below:

## Interview Cake
Contains the finished exercises from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/all-questions/java)

## Practice
Contains implementation of common algorithms, data structures and challenges I found randomly.
