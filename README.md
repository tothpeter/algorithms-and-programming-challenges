### In JavaScript
- String related challenges
  - Minify string

### In ruby
- Find the sub array of an array of integers which has the biggest sum
- Fibonacci
  - iterative
  - recursive
  - recursive with memoize
- Find unique integer in a list that contains duplicated integers and one single not duplicated one
- Classic fizz buzz challenge
- Find the highest product of 3 integers in an array
- Singly linked list
  - add nodes
  - loop detection O(n) time, O(1) space
  - reverse the order in place O(n) time, O(1) space
- LRU (last recently used) cache
- Merge ranges challenge
- Multiplication every number in an array except the current index
- Rectangular overlapping
- String related challenges
  - Reverse string in place O(n) time, O(1) space
  - Reverse words in place O(n) time, O(1) space
  - Any palindrome
    - Find out if we could build up a palindrome from the given string by permute its letters
  - Generate all permutations of a string, use recursive function anyway
  - Count the substrings
    - We have a random string, the task is to answer how many at least two character long substrings does it contain which has maximum two different letters.
- Trees
  - Binary search tree
    - add nodes
    - find the second largest value
    - determine the height of a tree (both recursive and iterative)
    - determine the width of a tree (The width of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two terminal nodes (leaves) in the tree)
    - construction from given preorder list
    - traversals: preorder, postorder
