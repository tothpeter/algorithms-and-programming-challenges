# Trees
## The implemented algorithms so far

- Binary search tree
    - add nodes
    - find the second largest value
    - determine the height of a tree (both recursive and iterative)
    - determine the width of a tree (The width of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two terminal nodes (leaves) in the tree)
    - construction from given preorder list
    - traversals: preorder, postorder
