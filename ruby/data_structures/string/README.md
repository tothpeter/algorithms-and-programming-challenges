# String related challenges
## The implemented algorithms so far

- Reverse string in place O(n) time, O(1) space
- Reverse words in place O(n) time, O(1) space
- Any palindrome
  - Find out if we could build up a palindrome from the given string by permute its letters
- Generate all permutations of a string, use recursive function anyway
- Count the substrings
  - We have a random string, the task is to answer how many at least two character long substrings does it contain which has maximum two different letters.
